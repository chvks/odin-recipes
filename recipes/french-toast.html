        <h2> Steps to Making French Toast</h2>

        <p>If you're looking for the best French toast recipe on the internet, you've come to the right place. 
            This tender, fluffy, and indulgent recipe comes together quickly and easily with just five ingredients you already have on hand. </p>

        <p>Here's everything you need to know about making the best French toast of your life, including the best bread to use and what ingredients you need. Plus, get our best storage secrets and freezer hacks.</p>    

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><h5>White Bread</h5>
                <p>Thick-cut bread is the base for all French toast. Sturdy, dense, slightly stale slices absorb the custard-like egg mixture better than thin, airy ones</p></li>

            <li><h5>Eggs</h5>
                <p>When it comes to French toast, eggs are essential. The proteins solidify once they're heated, which binds the batter together and ensures a rich texture. The fat, meanwhile, adds extra creaminess.  </p></li>  
                
            <li><h5>Milk</h5>
                <p>You can technically use any liquid to make French toast, though milk is most popular. Not only does milk add the necessary moisture, but the fat gives the batter extra richness. 
                This recipe calls for whole milk because it creates the ideal texture. You can easily substitute half-and-half, cream, or your favorite alternative milk â€“ full-fat varieties will produce the creamiest consistency.</p></li>    

            <li><h5>Vanilla and Cinamon</h5>
                <p>The best French toast is warm, cozy, aromatic, and sweet. The cinnamon and vanilla in this recipe are optional, but we definitely recommend using them for the most delicious experience. You could even add a little nutmeg or sugar if you feel like it.</p></li>

            <li><h5>Butter</h5>
            <p>Like so many of the most decadent foods, the best French toast is made with butter. If your French toast has the tendency to burn, try frying the batter-soaked bread in a combination of butter and oil.</p></li>    
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Whisk milk, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt together in a shallow bowl.  
            </li>
            <li>Lightly butter a griddle and heat over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Dunk bread in the egg mixture, soaking both sides. Transfer to the hot skillet and cook until golden, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
